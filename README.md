# Ad-hoc-Analysis-AtliQ-Hardwares-
SQL Ad-hoc Analysis Project for AtliQ Hardwares using MySQL

🎥 Watch Video Explanation : https://youtu.be/cDtLC7lCQw0

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardwares is a computer hardware manufacturing company that sells products globally through various channels like Amazon, Croma, and Best Buy. AtliQ Hardwares,relied completely on Excel to manage its growing business. As sales and revenue increased, their Excel files became larger and harder to handle — until one day, their key business planning file crashed beyond recovery.

To fix this, AtliQ built a proper MySQL database That’s when they brought in a data analytics team to make the company truly data-informed by solving ad-hoc business problems with SQL. The Product Owner often requests data insights and business reports to support decision-making and improve operational efficiency.

Currently, the data team receives multiple ad-hoc analysis requests from stakeholders to help them understand sales trends, market performance, product demand, and forecast accuracy.
The goal of this project is to create a centralized SQL-based solution to quickly respond to these business questions using views, joins, and stored procedures.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to:

- Perform ad-hoc business analysis using SQL.
- Automate repetitive analysis by creating stored procedures.
- Build reusable queries to generate quick reports for different business needs.
- Help the product owner make data-driven decisions for product, market, and customer strategy.

## Datasets Used
This project uses multiple tables from the AtliQ Hardwares database (gdb0041) to perform ad-hoc business analysis and reporting.

⚙️ Stored Procedure Automation
Here you can see — this task was quite repetitive.
Because tomorrow the product owner might ask for the same report for Amazon or eBay, I created a stored procedure called
get_monthly_gross_sales_for_customer.

Now, by simply entering the customer code, the report is automatically generated — no need to rewrite the query every time.

As a product owner, I want to create a stored procedure that determines the market badge based on total sold quantity.
If the total sold quantity exceeds 5 million units, the market is considered Gold; otherwise, it is Silver.

🎯 Objective
Categorize markets as Gold or Silver based on total sales volume.
Enable quick classification by market and fiscal year.
Simplify repetitive reporting through automation.

🧩 Ad Hoc Request 4 — Top Markets, Products, and Customers by Net Sales
📄 Problem Statement
As a product owner, I want a report for top markets, products, and customers by net sales for a given financial year.
This will help provide a holistic view of AtliQ's financial performance and enable better business decisions.

🧱 Step 1: Creating the Net Sales View
Before creating stored procedures, I built a Net Sales View that combines necessary data (e.g., gross sales, discounts, and other adjustments) into one clean, reusable table.

⚙️ Step 2: Stored Procedures for Analysis
I created three separate stored procedures to fetch the top markets, top products, and top customers for any given financial year.

💡 Key Insight
The analysis highlights which customers contributed the most to the company’s total net sales in FY-2021, helping identify top revenue drivers for better business planning.

🧾 Ad Hoc Request 6 — Top N Products by Quantity Sold (Per Division)
📄 Problem Statement
As a product owner, I want to get the Top N products in each division based on their quantity sold for a given financial year.
This helps analyze which products are performing best within each division.

⚙️ Stored Procedure
To make this reusable, I created a stored procedure that dynamically takes two inputs:

in_fiscal_year → Financial year to analyze
in_top_n → Number of top products to display per division

💡 Key Insight
This stored procedure helps quickly identify best-performing products within each division, reducing manual effort and improving decision-making for inventory and sales strategy.

🧾 Ad Hoc Request 7 — Forecast Accuracy for All Customers
📄 Problem Statement
As a product owner, I need an aggregate forecast accuracy report for all customers for a given fiscal year, so that I can track how accurate our forecasts are compared to actual sales.

The report includes the following fields:

Customer Code, Name, Market
Total Sold Quantity
Total Forecast Quantity
Net Error
Absolute Error
Forecast Accuracy %
⚙️ Data Preparation
To achieve this, I first created a new table called fact_act_est by combining both fact_sales_monthly and fact_forecast_monthly tables.

I used LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to ensure we include customers who had sales but no forecast and forecast but no sales.
This ensures no data is missed.
Then, I updated all NULL values to 0, as instructed by the product owner.

🧩 Stored Procedure
After preparing the data, I created a stored procedure to calculate forecast accuracy for each customer.
It takes the fiscal year as input and outputs the forecast accuracy % based on total forecast and actual sales data.

🔗 View Stored Procedure Query

🖥️ Procedure Execution
📥 Input: Fiscal Year (e.g., 2021)
Input

📤 Output: Forecast accuracy report with all customer details
Output

💡 Key Insight
This stored procedure automates the forecast accuracy calculation and ensures that product owners can easily monitor prediction performance for each customer.
It helps identify gaps between actual and forecasted sales, allowing the business to improve its planning and forecasting models.

🏁 Conclusion
Through this SQL project, I explored a series of real-world ad-hoc business requests and delivered insights that a product owner or analyst would typically need.

Each request focused on solving a specific business problem — from sales performance and forecast accuracy to market share tracking — using
SQL queries, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), joins, stored procedures, and aggregate functions.

💡 Key Learnings
This project helped me strengthen my ability to:

🧩 Write clean, modular SQL queries for analytical needs
🔗 Use joins, subqueries, CTEs, and stored procedures effectively
📊 Translate business questions into data-driven insights
📈 Final Takeaway
This project represents how a data analyst would handle, analyze, and present business data using SQL in a real-world environment.

✅ This concludes the Ad Hoc Analysis Project for AtliQ Hardwares.
